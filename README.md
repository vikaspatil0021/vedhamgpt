# Vedham - AI Image Caption Generator

Vedham is a project that takes images as input and provides captions based on the contents of the image. These captions can be used in social media posts or any other creative content. The project utilizes two AI-based APIs, namely ChatGPT API and Clarifai Image Caption Generation AI API, to achieve this functionality.
